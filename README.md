# Case Management System made in Spring with hashing, salting and custom JWT
## Published as REST API by our [Jaxson Project](https://github.com/peferb/jaxson/blob/master/README.md)

###Made to demonstrate the following techniques:
  + Security by Token based authentication ([this, master branch](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/blob/master/project/src/main/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/service/SecurityUserService.java))
  + Security by JWT ([see jwt branch](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/tree/jwt/project/src/main/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/security))
  + Hashing and Salting
  + Spring Data JPA
  + Spring MVC
  + Spring Boot
  + Auditing
  + Paging
  + In-memory database ([for testing](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/blob/master/project/src/test/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/system/TestWorkItemIntegration.java))
  + Mysql
  + Convenient switching of underlying database implementation ([see Spring config](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/tree/master/project/src/main/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/config))
