# Case management system made in Spring
### Last assignment in Java Enterprise course

####Made to demonstrate the following techniques:
  + Implementing JWT from scratch ([see jwt branch](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/tree/jwt/project/src/main/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/security))
  + Simple Token based authorization, not JWT ([this, master branch](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/blob/master/project/src/main/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/service/SecurityUserService.java))
  + Spring Data JPA
  + Auditing
  + Paging
  + In-memory database ([for testing](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/blob/master/project/src/test/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/system/TestWorkItemIntegration.java), MySql for production)
  + Convenient switching of underlying database implementation ([see Spring config](https://github.com/peferb/springcasemanagement/tree/master/project/src/main/java/se/teknikhogskolan/springcasemanagement/config))
